## [Simulink Models](SPO2.md)

## [Real Time Systems Different Schedular Implementations](SPO2.md)

Using an Arduino Mega and the serial monitor, I implemented several scheduling algorithms (Rate-Monotonic, Deadline-Monotonic, Original Ceiling Priority Protocol, and Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol) in C. Based on a set of tasks with defined deadlines, execution times, and periods, I verified the correctness of each algorithmâ€™s behavior and outcomes, then analyzed their scheduling results to demonstrate the differences in performance and behavior among them.
