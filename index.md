## [Privacy Implication of Using Assistive Technologies on the Web ](SPO2.md)
For a year and a half, I analyzed potential privacy risks faced by screen reader users when navigating ad-driven websites. Using both manual methods and a custom large-scale automated process that simulated screen reader navigation and interaction behaviors (hover, click, tab), I collected and analyzed extensive datasets to identify how user data is tracked through ad interactions.

# [Autonomous Intersection Management System](SPO2.md)
With a partner, we refined a given Crossroads scheduling algorithm to account for real-world vehicle behavior—length and turn maneuvers(left/right/straight) to boost both efficiency and safety. We proved collision avoidance and overall correctness with KeYmaera X (a hybrid theorem prover) then validated performance in a custom MATLAB intersection simulator.

## [Real Time Systems Different Schedular Implementations](SPO2.md)

Using an Arduino Mega and the serial monitor, I implemented several scheduling algorithms (Rate-Monotonic, Deadline-Monotonic, Original Ceiling Priority Protocol, and Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol) in C. Based on a set of tasks with defined deadlines, execution times, and periods, I verified the correctness of each algorithm’s behavior and outcomes, then analyzed their scheduling results to demonstrate the differences in performance and behavior among them.
